How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I felt the viewing of differance between two files are so easy.Even when 
    I use the documents with large number of lines, It is also easy to find the differances between them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I think using Dropbox is more easy to make me efficient.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I don't think as it is a problem. We can do it manually without more effort.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    The changes in one file may affect other files related to it. So using multiple commits in one file is a good way.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Both are realy awesome. I used git log to view the history of the files and git diff for comparing two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's realy interesting. I am confident that I can make changes using version control in my upcoming projects.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I have interest to do with git for large codes
